# Icing

## History
In ancient Greek history, King Sisyphus was made to roll a huge boulder endlessly up a steep hill. The maddening nature of the punishment was reserved for King Sisyphus due to his hubristic belief that his cleverness surpassed that of Zeus himself.

Zeus accordingly displayed his own cleverness by enchanting the boulder into rolling away from King Sisyphus before he reached the top, which ended up consigning Sisyphus to an eternity of useless efforts and unending frustration.

Little is it known that after 3000 years King Sisyphus was able to reach the top of the mountain. There he found a Smirnoff Ice waiting for him placed by Zeus. Making Sisyphus the first in history to be iced and Zeus the almighty bro.

## Rules
The rules are simple: If a person sees a Smirnoff Ice, he or she must get down on one knee and chug it.

### Getting Iced
1. The icee has to do it to themselves (i.e an action that reveals the ice. For example opening a door and see the ice).
1. If an individual gets iced and no one is around to witness it they must live-stream it on Facebook.
1. If you refuse to take the ice you will be shunned and booed for 2 days.

### Ice Block
In addition to the rules of getting iced, if the victim of an ice attack happens to be carrying their own Smirnoff, they reserve the right to _‚Äúice block‚Äù_, which reverses the punishment back onto the attacker. 

1. An individual can _‚Äúice block‚Äù_ an ice if the individual has an ice in arms reach, and chooses to summon it.
1. 1L are legal.
1. A reverse Uno card can be used but it needs to be from a real Uno pack and must be burnt after use.

### Void
1. An individual can void and ice if they claim the location of the ice before the ice is revealed.
1. If the claim is valid the icer gets iced.
1. If the claim is wrong the claimer must buy an ice or a drink of 345 ml and chug it in at least 2 seconds if it is not alcoholic.

### Special Icing Forms
The following drinks are included in icing:
1. **Smirnoff Ice 1L**: can be used if you ice the individual gets Iced 3 times in a row.
1. ~~**GODS NECTAR** (PABST): is considered low tier but can still be used. If an individual gets Pabst'd they must shotgun it.~~ PBR IS ILLEGAL
1. **Yeethanize**: The use of Delirium is highly respected as it is a rare boi. Limit of 5 per day.

### Deferred Ices
1. The icee and ask the icer to defer the ice for 6 hours. The icer must agree to these conditions or it must be taken on the spot.
